      <div class="title movement">Devlog #2 (27/9/2021)</div>
      <p>

        Hello again! Since we last left off, the dev team has made significant progress in developing some new ideas, as well as iterating on older ones. So without further delay, let’s dive in!
        <br><br>

        <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Lock And Load, Ranger</div>

        Over the past few weeks, the team has managed to greatly define and detail the Rangers. As many of you know, the Rangers are the most elite infantry force of the mech-ridden battlefields of Project Vanguard. Because of this, we wanted to ensure they look and feel extra badass.
        <br><br>

        Ranger candidates are handpicked from the ranks of Project Vanguard’s marine corps, selected specifically for their exemplary effectiveness, experience, and discipline. They go through years of intensive training and conditioning in order to produce the most effective soldiers humanity has to offer. There have even been rumors of some sort of augmentation being performed on Ranger trainees.
        <br><br>

        In the more advanced stages of training, Rangers choose a certification to specialize in, allowing them to further hone their skills into a more specific combat role. Here is concept art of Blur, a speedster Ranger certification which specializes in ultra-fast speed and maneuverability, courtesy of character artist extraordinaire Ghost.
        <br><br>

        <img src="devlog_images/Ranger Blur concept.png" style="margin-bottom:15px;" alt="ranger concept" width="" height="" class="center">

        Blur Rangers utilize enhanced jumpkit technology in order to achieve these great feats of speed and agility, often going so fast as to completely disorient rank-and-file marines. In order to master their high-powered jumpkits, blur candidates undergo additional high-g and cardio-vascular training among other things.
        <br><br>

        Another Ranger certification also illustrated by Ghost is Grapple. These Rangers employ highly durable and flexible grappling hooks capable of supporting the massive weight and strain of a fully-equipped Ranger in order to propel themselves across the battlefield.
        <br><br>

        <img src="devlog_images/Grapple Concept.png" style="margin-bottom:15px;" alt="blur concept" width="" height="" class="center">

        <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">It's Just Business</div>

        With all their advanced training and combat gear, a Ranger is still just flesh and bone when pitted against a couple armor-piercing rounds - so it was only natural that we needed weapons to go along with their more sophisticated tastes. Lucky for us, Olympian Incorporated was up to the challenge.
        <br><br>

        Olympian Inc. is one of the major weapons manufacturers of Project Vanguard’s universe - known for their expensive, stylish, and high-tech weaponry. Originally a high-class spaceliner, Olympian would expand into private security for extrasolar colonies and starships following the widespread adoption of faster-than-light travel. Eventually, their security force’s in-house weaponry would prove to be so successful that the company would begin to delve into military contracting.
        <br><br>

        One of Olympian’s most popular and well-rounded weapons is the LR-11 Carbine. Here is some concept art courtesy of the glorious F1shy.
        <br><br>

        <img src="devlog_images/LR11 concept final.png" style="margin-bottom:15px;" alt="weapon concept" width="" height="" class="center">

        The carbine features a lightweight, skeletonized frame - allowing for ease of use and transport. Various other high-tech integrations, like the use of round accelerator technology, makes the LR-11 the go-to choice for many Rangers.
        <br><br>

        Another Olympian design in the L-Series of weapons is the LX Typhoon, with art again courtesy of F1shy.
        <br><br>

        <img src="devlog_images/TX typhoon final.png" style="margin-bottom:15px;" alt="weapon concept" width="" height="" class="center">

        The Typhoon is Olympian’s premier LMG. Due to its L-Series heritage, the weapon possesses a skeletonized frame similar to that of the LR-11. Its use of telescoped ammunition allows for additional weight reduction, as well as increased reliability among a variety of other benefits.
        <br><br>

        Although Olympian has some fantastic-looking weapons, there are many other foundries ready to meet Rangers’ needs. Ali & Gao is renowned across human space for their reliable, workhorse designs - while others like Stryker Arms are known for their more heavy duty, high-powered approach to weaponry.
        <br><br>

        <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Closing Words</div>

        Before we end this month’s devlog, the team has some important news. We are currently looking for experienced programmers to contribute to the project. If you have experience with multiplayer programming (bonus if you have experience with the Mirror Networking library for Unity) and are interested in contributing, please contact us through any of our social media accounts! Once again, thank you all for your patience and support as we continue to make progress on development. Blur, Grapple, and Olympian are just a small taste of what we have developed so far, so stay tuned for more updates soon!
