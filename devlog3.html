      <div class="title movement">Devlog #3 (??/5/2022)</div>
      <p>
          
          After a long wait and numerous setbacks, devlog 3 is finally here - packed full of new content of all forms! We have guns, attachments, rangers new and old and even a sneak peak into an in-development map to show!
          <br><br>
          
          Again, everything showcased here is extremely subject to change, so try not to get too attached to anything.
          <br><br>
          
<!-- CORSAIR==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
          
          <div class="title movement-subheading-small">Corsair</div>
        
        Some aging rangers may remember a couple of ranger concepts featured in the devlogs of yore. As time passed and new eyes were able to study those designs, the team decided a revamp was due. One of the rangers to receive this special treatment was the grapple ranger.
        <br><br>
        
        Now sporting a new name -yet still as dashing as ever- Corsair has been overhauled from the ground up. With the ability to swing across the battlefield via the use of their grappling hook, Corsair will be the ranger of choice for those who enjoy feeling the cool breeze in their hair while engaging in firefights.
        <br><br>
        
        As you can see, Corsair’s helmet went through many changes. However, enjoyers of  single-eyed helmets will be pleased to learn that the cyclops-like design is here to stay.
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Corsair BTS</div>
        
 <!-- BLUR==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">Blur</div>
        
        Speed is life on the battlefield, and no other ranger embodies this more than Blur. Returning alongside Corsair from the pages of devlog 1, Blur too has received a major redesign.
        <br><br>
        
        A lightweight, aerodynamic chassis allows this synth to reach speeds that would kill any normal human. Rumored to be able to move faster than a bullet, most who encounter Blur never saw them coming - and they weren't given the chance to learn.
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Blur BTS</div>
        
<!-- TEMPEST==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">Tempest</div>
        
        Armed with a menagerie of highly experimental equipment, Tempest is capable of rapid short-term teleportation. Near infinitely unpredictable to fight, the mere shine of its interwoven polymer skin can make even the most veteran of marines lay down their weapons.
        <br><br>
        
        However, due to the incredible stress that matter translocation places on one's body, the maneuver would kill even the strongest human ranger, forcing all prospective Tempest cadets to undergo a "second wind" procedure.
        <br><br>
        
        Don't count on these soldiers staying in one place for long. Before you know it, they could be right behind you in the blink of an eye.
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Tempest BTS</div>
        
<!-- AEGIS==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">Aegis</div>
        
        Another new addition to the ever growing roster of rangers is Aegis. This tanky supersoldier is capable of taking punishment far in excess of any typical ranger, in large part due to cutting-edge advancements in overshield technology. Prospective Aegis mains can expect to be able to single-handedly halt pushes without breaking a sweat.
        <br><br>

        <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Aegis BTS</div>
        
<!-- ORACLE==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">Oracle</div>
        
        With their ability to reveal the locations of enemies, Oracle can scout the battlefield like no other. Their drones give them unparalleled levels of information about the battlefield, and allow them to pose a formidable threat to every combatant. With Oracle on the field, no position is secure, and no camper hidden. So beware! They will come for you.... And they will find you!
        <br><br>
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Oracle BTS</div>
        
<!-- GEIST==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">Geist</div>
        
        Specialist ambush predators, a Geist knows their advantage is brief but deadly. Under cloak, these rangers exploit the most versatile of war-time advantages and the best of them can take apart any squad piece-meal without even conceding a glimpse. Only the lucky few have seen them: Light-scattering metamaterials conceal them from the battlefield, and the many-eyed visor glare burns onto the retina.
        <br><br>
        
        But without luck? By the time you see the shimmer, it's already too late.
        <br><br>
        
<!-- LR11==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">LR-11 Carbine</div>
        
        Across the Ecumene, Olympian Inc. is known for their incredible firearms- and the LR-11 is no exception! This rifle is not known merely for its stunning beauty- instead, rangers and mercenaries alike know it for its shocking performance. Forever in high demand, it's a tool known to accompany only the wealthy, powerful, and dangerous.
        <br><br>
        
        Rangers love the high fire rate- since it’s able to empty a magazine of high-powered ammunition in just a few seconds! But for them, that’s just a juicy extra… The real effectiveness of this weapon is in the exceptional recoil control, and very capable silencer. With the LR-11, firing a shot feels like the gentle kiss of a midsummer breeze, and sounds like the buzz of a bee. 
Pleasant. Enjoyable. And always utterly deadly.

<!-- OFG==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">OFG</div>
        
        The Open Frame Gunsight, or OFG, is the very latest in target acquisition technology from Konig Tactical. With the OFG, soldiers lose less situational awareness than competing, Closed Frame solutions! And Konig’s revolutionary design uses state of the art technology to precisely project onto a stream of aerosolized reflective particles. This system removes the need for the traditional glass projection surface, rendering the OFG significantly more impact and shock resistant than any other sight could ever be.
        <br><br>

<!-- SALVAGE==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">Salvage</div>
        
        This abandoned ship breaking yard was once the beating heart of the system’s entire economic structure. This facility was a critical part of the race to salvage and reuse the ships of the other side- naturally making it a key target. The planet was bombarded- killing what little life there was, and destroying much of the surface.
        <br><br>
        
        Left for decades, the fierce winds of this planet broke down rock into a fine grit. Where there were once great mountain ranges, there now was a desert of sharp and stingy sand, whipped about by the fierce winds. And what became of the shipbreaking yard? All that remains are shattered relics, impressive monuments to what once were humanity’s greatest and largest ships.
        <br><br>
        
<!-- UI==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">UI Draft</div>
        
        And now, a quick mock up of a loadout screen. This is by no means anywhere near final- it’s likely that  the content will change, as will the formatting- features like Tato’s lovely concept art will almost certainly get replaced with a 3d model. But it is an insight into the general design language we’re looking into for Project Vanguard. This mockup was made by Falz!
        <br><br>
        
<!-- OUTRO==================================================================================================================================================================================== -->
        
        <div class="title movement-subheading-small">La Fin</div>
        
        That finally concludes devlog 3. But before we sound off, we'd like to include a little bit about the near future of the project. Over the next coming weeks, more of our team will finish their academic years and enter summer holidays. This will hopefully mean faster and more consistent progress these next few months, so be sure to keep an eye out!
