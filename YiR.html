      A Vanguard. The foremost part of a force or movement.
      <br><br>
      
      Vanguard was our response to the abandonment of Titanfall. With the series adrift, the community did not know where to go. Titanfall was at the whims of investors, and a company who saw greener pastures elsewhere. With the games on life support, hackers were everywhere uncombated. Numerous RCE scares, DoS attacks- the games were often unplayable, or we were scared to play them. Vanguard was part of the same movement to revive Titanfall that brought us Northstar- but Northstar is not much more than a prosthetic. It runs on a game that you may not even be able to buy tomorrow, something that is almost for all intents and purposes abandonware.
      <br><br>
      
      Vanguard is a game for the Titanfall community, by the Titanfall community. We knew we were embarking on a long voyage- games are big, complex, sprawling machines, often built by dozens or hundreds of people. We are but a team of volunteers. But this past year, we’ve made great progress. Work continues to build a robust multiplayer structure, dozens of pieces of high-quality concept art have inspired us, detailed 3d models have been modeled and textured.
      <br><br>
      
      A year ago, we committed to this project. There were some peaks of productivity and moments where the project lay in slumber. But we’ve pushed through them all, and we believe we can push this project through to completion. We know it’s not gonna take us merely another year- but we’re not gonna let down this project, this community, this dream.
      <br><br>
      
      So on that note- here’s much of what we’ve worked on. What each of us is most proud of, and what we’re excited for in the year to come.
      <br><br>
      
      Please note that everything included in this is NOT finalized, or in any way guaranteed to be a part of the final game. This is a showcase of some of the work we have done over the past year, including some work that has been heavily modified or dropped already.

      I’m a designer and concept artist, working on designing our mechs, rangers, and weapons. Since joining the project in March, a lot of my explorations have been done in tandem with Jonny and Tato, with their distinct styles being a deep well to draw from.
      <br><br>
        
      Here are some concepts and designs for equipment, mostly weaponry. On this front, I mostly work in collaboration with the writing team, and especially the 3d artists. Kinetic.
      <br><br>
        
      I’ve also been spearheading the mecha design. This realm of design is more delicate, despite the heavy-duty subject. Most enjoyable is finding the balance between purpose built war machine and making each one an individual.
      <br><br>
        
      Creating and refining our visual style directly in cooperation with fellow devs from all stations is invaluable to me. I’ve contributed hundreds of designs and drawings, with plans for several hundred more.
      <br><br>
       
      Thanks for everything.
      <br><br>
        
      <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Tato</div>
      
      Hi, I'm Tato. I'm a digital concept artist. I oversaw Character art and established a distinct style for the project, drawing from our inspirations while still going for something unique and original. I concepted the majority of the rangers and some other characters with help and feedback from the rest of the team.
      <br><br>
        
      I’ve made a few concepts for the environment and overall look of the world. While we're not too far yet on this aspect of the project, these concepts help paint a picture of what the maps and the world around them might feel like aesthetically.
      <br><br>
        
      I also drafted this promo image!
      <br><br>
        
      In the beginning of the project we had no proper pipeline yet, and as such a lot of our first or second drafts immediately got passed without reconsideration, leading to the massive redesigns of both blur and Corsair inbetween devlog 2 and 3. The way it works now is, one of the idea departments (either writers or game dev) asks for concept art of something, the team drafts their own impression of the prompt, we pass our drafts to someone else within concept art and then they work further  on that concept, creating a more refined final concept in which the entire concept team contributed.
      <br><br>
        
      A special thank you to the team that has helped me both grow as an artist and dealt with my absurdities for almost a year now.
      <br><br>
        
      And another special thank you to the community that keeps me and the rest of the team motivated to do the best we can. TATO OUT.
      <br><br>
        
      <div class="title movement-subheading-smallp">Jonny</div>
      
      Hello everyone! I'm Jonny, red cross EMT and freelance concept artist in Austria, near Vienna. Fun fact- lots of my concepts were sketched in the back of an ambulance or while waiting for emergencies on station.
      <br><br>
        
      This project has been lots of fun. I really enjoyed crafting designs, reiterating them based on feedback and seeing them become part of the universe we are creating. I’ll be honest- I don’t see myself on the same level in terms of creating finished pieces as the other artists on the team. I mostly focus on sketches to convey ideas. However, I’ve improved my painting and shading skills a lot over the course of this project, thanks to practice and feedback from other artists (special thanks to Tato!).
      <br><br>

      As a concept artist I was involved in a lot of stuff. I also tried myself on 3D-modeling since I had experience in CAD, but always failed at preparing the models for the game engine. I often quickly sketched ideas that came to mind, most of which were later abandoned- but some stayed.
